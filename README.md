With the **LAYR Open Chip Challenge**, we are creating a platform on which students themselves become drivers of innovation: We are looking for creative open-source chip designs that grow technically in several stages of the competition, address real security aspects, and are accompanied through to physical tape-out. The focus is not only on technical skills, but also on active participation in digital value chains and sovereignty - from the idea to the functional silicon solution.
