# The LAYR 25/26 demonstrator

![LAYR Demonstrator v0.5](pics/demonstrator_v0.5.jpg)

## Description
The LAYR demonstrator is a hardware device. It brings the microchips to live and shows the functionality of the doorlock. Over the span of the LAYR 25/26 challenge the demonstrator goes through some development stages and various enhancements. 

The components of the LAYR hardware kit are used in the demonstrator to assemble a doorlock.

## FPGA prototyping

#### Bitstream for ULX3S 85F FPGA board
There is a bitstream for the ULX3S 85F FPGA board available. This implementations solves all task of the LAYR 25/26 challenge. The HDL sources of the bitstream are not published yet, as they would give away a full solution for the LAYR challenge.

#### Flashing the bitstream
The bitstream can be flashed to the ULX3S with the tool fujprog. For the usage, see the readme of fujprog here:
